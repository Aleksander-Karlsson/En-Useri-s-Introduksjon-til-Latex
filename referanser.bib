    abstract = {The task of protecting users' privacy is made more difficult by their attitudes towards information disclosure without full awareness and the economics of the tracking and advertising industry. Even after numerous press reports and widespread disclosure of leakages on the Web and on popular Online Social Networks, many users appear not be fully aware of the fact that their information may be collected, aggregated and linked with ambient information for a variety of purposes. Past attempts at alleviating this problem have addressed individual aspects of the user's data collection. In this paper we move towards a comprehensive and efficient client-side tool that maximizes users' awareness of the extent of their information leakage. We show that such a customizable tool can help users to make informed decisions on controlling their privacy footprint.},
